# Lab 11: Set up Ansible dynamic inventories to automatically discover and manage infrastructure. Use Ansible Galaxy role to install Apache.
## Overview
Dynamic inventories allow Ansible to automatically discover and manage infrastructure by querying an external source, such as cloud providers or configuration management databases. Ansible Galaxy roles are reusable units of Ansible content that can simplify playbook tasks. This lab will guide you through creating a dynamic inventory script and using an Ansible Galaxy role to install Apache on managed hosts. 
## Step-by-Step Guide
### Step 1: Install Ansible
Make sure Ansible is installed on your control node. You can install Ansible using the following command:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ansible -y
```
### Step 2: Configure Dynamic Inventory
Dynamic inventories can be configured using a script or plugin. For cloud environments, such as AWS, you can use the ec2 plugin.
#### 1- Install Required Collections
```
ansible-galaxy collection install amazon.aws
```
#### 2- Configure the ansible.cfg File Ensure your ansible.cfg file points to the dynamic inventory script
```
[defaults]
inventory = ./aws_ec2.yml 
```
#### 3- Create a Dynamic Inventory Script Create a dynamic_inventory.yml file:
```
plugin: amazon.aws.ec2
regions:
  - us-east-1
filters:
  instance-state-name: running
```
This script uses the ec2 plugin to list running instances in the us-east-1 region. Make sure you have the necessary AWS credentials set up on your system, or use aws configure to set them up.
### Step 3: Use Ansible Galaxy Role to Install Apache
#### 1- Install the Apache Role Use Ansible Galaxy to install a pre-existing role for Apache:
```
ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.apache
```
#### 2- Create a Playbook to Install Apache Create a install_apache.yml file to use the Apache role:
```
- name: Install Apache on all managed nodes
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  roles:
    - geerlingguy.apache
```
### Step 4: Run the Playbook
####  Execute the playbook with the following command:
```
ansible-playbook install_apache.yml
```
## Expected Output
When you run the ansible-playbook command, you should see output similar to this:
```
PLAY [Install Apache on all managed nodes] *************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] *********************************************************
ok: [instance-1]
ok: [instance-2]

TASK [geerlingguy.apache : Ensure Apache is installed] ************************
ok: [instance-1]
ok: [instance-2]

TASK [geerlingguy.apache : Ensure Apache is started and enabled] ****************
ok: [instance-1]
ok: [instance-2]

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
instance-1                  : ok=3    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0   
instance-2                  : ok=3    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0   
```
### Explanation of the Output
- ok=3: The number of tasks that completed successfully.
- changed=0: The number of tasks that modified the target system (none in this case, since the role is idempotent).
- unreachable=0: Number of hosts that were unreachable (zero means all hosts were reachable).
- failed=0: Number of tasks that failed (zero means all tasks succeeded).
## Commands Summary
### 1- Install Ansible:
```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ansible -y
```
### 2- Install Ansible Galaxy collection:
```
ansible-galaxy collection install amazon.aws
```
### 3- Create the dynamic inventory configuration file (dynamic_inventory.yml).
### 4-Install the Apache role from Ansible Galaxy:
```
ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.apache
```
### 5- Create and run the playbook:
```
ansible-playbook install_apache.yml
```
